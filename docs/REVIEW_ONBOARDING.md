# Code Review Standards - Team Onboarding

## For PR Authors

### Before Creating a PR:
1. Self-review using the [Code Review Checklist](CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Write descriptive commit messages
3. Keep PRs focused and < 400 lines
4. Add screenshots for UI changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly

### Creating the PR:
1. The template auto-populates - fill out all relevant sections
2. Remove sections that don't apply
3. Be specific about what needs review attention
4. Link related issues

### After Submitting:
1. Respond to feedback within 24 hours
2. Ask clarifying questions if feedback is unclear
3. Make requested changes in new commits
4. Thank reviewers for their time

## For Reviewers

### Before Reviewing:
1. Read the PR description and linked issues
2. Check out the branch locally if needed
3. Set aside 30-60 minutes for thorough review

### During Review:
1. Use the [Code Review Checklist](CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
2. Focus on high-impact items first (security, correctness)
3. Provide specific, actionable feedback
4. Note both positives and areas for improvement
5. Test critical paths manually

### Review Guidelines:
- **Approve**: No blocking issues, ready to merge
- **Comment**: Discussion needed, questions to answer
- **Request Changes**: Blocking issues must be fixed

### Response Time:
- Initial review: Within 24 hours
- Follow-up: Within 4-8 hours
